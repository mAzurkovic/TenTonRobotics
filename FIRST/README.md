# FRC Directory

For the most part, we are using Java and the WPIlib for programming the FRC robot during the Steamworks competition.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/mAzurkovic/TenTonRobotics.git`
2. Change directory to the FRC projects: `cd FIRST`
3. Make sure you have the `WPIlib` Java extensions installed. If you are running it on Eclipse just add the WPIlib FRC Java/C++ package
4. Write some code and follow the `contributions` guidlines in the main `README.md`
